abstract = {Machine learning is enabling a myriad innovations, including new algorithms for cancer diagnosis and self-driving cars. The broad use of machine learning makes it important to understand the extent to which machine-learning algorithms are subject to attack, particularly when used in applications where physical security or safety is at risk.In this paper, we focus on facial biometric systems, which are widely used in surveillance and access control. We define and investigate a novel class of attacks: attacks that are physically realizable and inconspicuous, and allow an attacker to evade recognition or impersonate another individual. We develop a systematic method to automatically generate such attacks, which are realized through printing a pair of eyeglass frames. When worn by the attacker whose image is supplied to a state-of-the-art face-recognition algorithm, the eyeglasses allow her to evade being recognized or to impersonate another individual. Our investigation focuses on white-box face-recognition systems, but we also demonstrate how similar techniques can be used in black-box scenarios, as well as to avoid face detection.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples where inputs with imperceptible perturbations mislead DNNs to incorrect results. Recently, adversarial patch, with noise confined to a small and localized patch, emerged for its easy accessibility in real-world. However, existing attack strategies are still far from generating visually natural patches with strong attacking ability, since they often ignore the perceptual sensitivity of the attacked network to the adversarial patch, including both the correlations with the image context and the visual attention. To address this problem, this paper proposes a perceptual-sensitive generative adversarial network (PS-GAN) that can simultaneously enhance the visual fidelity and the attacking ability for the adversarial patch. To improve the visual fidelity, we treat the patch generation as a patch-to-patch translation via an adversarial process, feeding any types of seed patch and outputting the similar adversarial patch with high perceptual correlation with the attacked image. To further enhance the attacking ability, an attention mechanism coupled with adversarial generation is introduced to predict the critical attacking areas for placing the patches, which can help producing more realistic and aggressive patches. Extensive experiments under semi-whitebox and black-box settings on two large-scale datasets GTSRB and ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed PS-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial patch attack methods.},

abstract="In this paper, we present our deep attention-based classification (DABC) network for robust single image depth prediction, in the context of the Robust Vision Challenge 2018 (ROB 2018) (http://www.robustvision.net/index.php). Unlike conventional depth prediction, our goal is to design a model that can perform well in both indoor and outdoor scenes with a single parameter set. However, robust depth prediction suffers from two challenging problems: (a) How to extract more discriminative features for different scenes (compared to a single scene)? (b) How to handle the large differences of depth ranges between indoor and outdoor datasets? To address these two problems, we first formulate depth prediction as a multi-class classification task and apply a softmax classifier to classify the depth label of each pixel. We then introduce a global pooling layer and a channel-wise attention mechanism to adaptively select the discriminative channels of features and to update the original features by assigning important channels with higher weights. Further, to reduce the influence of quantization errors, we employ a soft-weighted sum inference strategy for the final prediction. Experimental results on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. It is worth mentioning that we won the 2-nd place in single image depth prediction entry of ROB 2018, in conjunction with IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2018.",

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks define an exceptionally powerful class of models, but are still limited by the lack of ability to be spatially invariant to the input data in a computationally and parameter efficient manner. In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.},
